  <li><strong>Lore</strong>: During the dark ages of Athensphere, the war slowly took its toll on the demigods. Having witnessed the endless carnage brought upon her people, Aurelia’s soul wept in silence. Amidst the death and destruction, a dark seed was sown within Aurelia’s bright soul. In time, her grief turned into spite towards the one who began the war. For the first time in her life, Aurelia felt a deep dark passion stirring within her. To end the ravages of war, she had to end the source of it all. With her newfound conviction, Aurelia picked up her harp and poured her soul into the birth of a new tune. A winged spirit emerged from within her, singing softly behind her ears an unholy melody that drained the life-force from anyone who had so successfully earned the ire of the benign demigod.</li>

  <li><strong>Lore</strong>: Having lost Athensphere’s undercity to the horde of Hellhounds, Hadaron made the decision to withdraw from the battlefield. Confused as to why and how his friend had succumbed to such madness, Hadaron set off on a mission to find Gazia. During his long journey across the chaos of the Void, he witnessed the atrocities wrought by Gazia. Augmented with the power of the Netherhound, Hadaron developed the Netherhound’s superior stealth and hunting abilities. In time, he discovered that the souls of the beasts infused into the machines still lived on. The Netherhounds somehow looked upon Hadaron as if he was part of their pack. Taking advantage of that flaw, Hadaron established himself as the “Alpha Hound”, proving himself the strongest amongst them by taking down a great many of Gazia’s mechanical beasts. Having subjugated Gazia’s Netherhounds, he used them as his eyes and ears, fighting under the cover of darkness. Hadaron became a dreaded phantom capable of attacking from almost anywhere, rapidly destroying key targets and facilities before vanishing without a trace.</li>

<h2 id="grand-quest-x1-dialogue">Grand Quest X1 Dialogue</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Noel: Ah! PLAYER_NAME! You’re late! I’ve been waiting for you.</li>
  <li>Noel: I’ve finally done it!</li>
  <li>Noel: With this machine, I will become the first person to unravel the mysteries behind the disappearance of the once super civilization!</li>
  <li>Noel: Hmm? Do pardon me. I’m getting carried away again.</li>
  <li>Noel: I call this, the “Memory Gear”!</li>
  <li>Noel: What does this machine do? Aha! Curious now, aren’t you?</li>
  <li>Noel: Let’s see…  Where do I begin?</li>
  <li>Noel: During our raid of the mysterious land mass that came out of the void rift in Grand Gaia, some of our Summoners were specially instucted to recover artifacts they might find of value.</li>
  <li>Noel: It is without a doubt that that place was a small part of Athensphere.</li>
  <li>Noel: Amongst the artifacts recovered, a  couple of crystal-like rods were  recovered.</li>
  <li>Noel: I have identified these to be  information storage devices of sorts.</li>
  <li>Noel: And you have been chosen as my test sub…  <em>cough</em> assistant!?</li>
  <li>Noel: With the “Memory Gear” on, it will run all the information from the crystal directly in your head.</li>
  <li>Noel: Amazing isn’t it? You would be the first to catch a glimpse of  Athensphere in its full glory!</li>
  <li>Noel: Excellent!  Come now, there is nothing to be afraid of. I’ve tested the “Memory Gear” myself.</li>
  <li>Noel: Please, sit here. I’ll strap this onto your head…</li>
  <li>Noel: Stop fidgeting! This won’t hurt a bit…</li>
  <li>Noel: Alright, I don’t have many crystals left…</li>
  <li>Noel: What happened to the rest?</li>
  <li>Noel: Don’t worry, they were all worthy sacrifices in the name of science!</li>
  <li>Noel: Have a good trip!</li>
  <li>Zedus: What is this madness? Where did these… monstosities come from?</li>
  <li>Zedus: I can take care of myself! Send out the Praetorian Guard!</li>
  <li>Zedus: I want these mechanical filth out of my city!</li>
  <li>Zedus: Commanders, meet me at the War Room. I will be there shortly.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Ultor! I must speak with you.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Yes, my lord?</li>
  <li>Zedus: Gazia had arranged for an audience with me a month ago.</li>
  <li>Zedus: He was to meet me at the Forum.</li>
  <li>Zedus: These unholy vermin have overrun the North, where the Forum is at.</li>
  <li>Zedus: We must save him at all cost.</li>
  <li>Zedus: <em>Sigh</em>… I must admit, we have been caught off guard.</li>
  <li>Zedus: How is it possible that such a massive force could slip by the city defenses unnoticed?</li>
  <li>Zedus: Ultor, what do you think?</li>
  <li>Ultor: It is impossible that a horde of mechanicle beasts could slip by our sentries and scouts unnoticed.</li>
  <li>Ultor: We were attacked from within the city parameters.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Forgive me my lord, but I do believe there’s a traitor in our midst.</li>
  <li>Zedus: There is nothing to forgive Ultor. You speak true.</li>
  <li>Zedus: We shall not rest until we find this traitor!</li>
  <li>Zedus: But first, we must attend to the issue at hand.</li>
  <li>Zedus: The city is being assaulted from every direction. Our City Watch is in disarray and are fighting blindly.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Unfortunately for us, the Forum is where the battle is thickest.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Gazia is no fool. He should be hiding at the Pantheon north of the Forum instead of confronting the enemy.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Ultor, I want you to retake the Forum back and secure the area.</li>
  <li>Zedus: An odd fellow Gazia may be, but it is without a doubt he possess the greatest mind in all of Athensphere.</li>
  <li>Zedus: We must not allow him to fall into our enemy’s hands!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Yes, my lord! It will be done.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Excellent!  I’d expect nothing less from you Ultor.</li>
  <li>Zedus: I know you will not fail me.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Once I’m done briefing the Commanders of the City Watch, I’ll meet you at the Forum.</li>
  <li>Zedus: One last thing, show a little restraint won’t you?</li>
  <li>Zedus: Else there would be nothing left for me to kill once I’m there!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Then I suggest you keep that briefing of yours short, my lord?</li>
  <li>Ultor: You know I never go easy on my opponents… no matter who they may be!</li>
  <li>Zedus: Hah! I’ll be sure to keep that in mind.</li>
  <li>Zedus: I’ll see you on the battlefield.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Yes, my lord!</li>
  <li>Ultor: <em>looks at you</em></li>
  <li>Ultor: Centurion! Our men awaits us across the river.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Let us make haste,Lord Zedus will not need to lift a single finger.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Machine or no… these foul beasts will learn the true meaning of fear!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Ultor: Curious… These machines are not just your regular mindless robots.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Like real beasts, they seem to fight with a certain feral cunning… but much stronger.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Could it be?</li>
  <li>Ultor: …</li>
  <li>Ultor: No. That is not possible.</li>
  <li>Ultor: He would not have done this, would he?</li>
  <li>Ultor: It matters not. For this treachery, no matter the enemy, I will cut them down where they stand!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Soldiers! Excellent work!</li>
  <li>Ultor: The alien scum seem to be aware of our presence here and are coming to greet us.</li>
  <li>Ultor: How convenient! The faster we get to them, the earlier we shall crush them!</li>
  <li>Ultor: For the glory of Athensphere, to the last…  KILL THEM ALL!!!</li>
</ul>

  <li>Ultor: Curious… These machines are not just your regular mindless robots.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Like real beasts, they seem to fight with a certain feral cunning… but much stronger.</li>

  <li>???: Ah… Greetings, General.</li>
  <li>???: It’s good to see that you are safe.</li>
  <li>Ultor: !!!</li>
  <li>Ultor: La… Lady Aurelia!?</li>
  <li>Ultor: What are you doing here? This area is not safe!</li>
  <li>Ultor: I will have my best men escort you back to…</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Thank you, General. I can take care of myself, but the people of the city are in need of help.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: I cannot simply hide when they need me most.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Will you be heading towards the North? That is where the battle is fiercest, is it not?</li>
  <li>Ultor: Yes, my lady.</li>
  <li>Ultor: But…</li>
  <li>Aurelia: That’s a relief~</li>
  <li>Aurelia: I am sure I will come to no harm in your presence.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Let us not dally any further, General. We should be on our way.</li>
  <li>Ultor: But I…</li>
  <li>Aurelia: …</li>
  <li>Ultor: Yes of course my lady.</li>
  <li>Ultor: I will personally see to it that you will come to no harm.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Centurion! I have faith in your abilities as a leader and a warrior.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Under no circumstance are you and your men allowed to leave her side.</li>
  <li>Ultor: If so much as a scratch lands on her…</li>
  <li>Ultor: <em>Gulps</em></li>
  <li>Ultor: You wouldn’t want to see what Lord Zedus would do to us when he’s mad, would you?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Ultor: <em>Gasp</em></li>
  <li>Ultor: FEAR MY WRATH, FOUL BEAST!!!</li>
  <li>Ultor: <em>Huff</em> <em>puff</em></li>
  <li>Ultor: Hah… haha!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Miserable filth! For the glory of Athensphere, we shall prevail!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Argh… These wounds…</li>
  <li>Ultor: To think that I have been humbled by simple machines… but I am thankful that I’ll live to fight another day!</li>
  <li>Ultor: … And that my men are safe.</li>
  <li>Ultor: It won’t be long before the last of these vile beasts are destroyed!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Lord Zedus, the way to Gazia is clear.</li>
  <li>Ultor: For Athensphere’s sake, I hope you find him quickly…</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Ultor: <em>Gasp</em></li>
  <li>Ultor: FEAR MY WRATH, FOUL BEAST!!!</li>
  <li>Ultor: <em>Huff</em> <em>puff</em></li>
  <li>Ultor: Hah… haha!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Miserable filth! For the glory of Athensphere, we shall prevail!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Argh… These wounds…</li>
  <li>Ultor: To think that I have been humbled by simple machines…</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Hush now big boy. Tis but a flesh wound.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: I’m here, remember?</li>
  <li>Aurelia: There, your wounds are healed!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Yes… thank you, my lady.</li>
  <li>Ultor: I feel much better already.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Glad to be of service, General~</li>
  <li>Aurelia: You are indeed a powerful warrior, but you are not invincible.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Valor and recklessness are very different qualities my dear. One of which will get you killed one day.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: I can see that you cherish the lives of you men.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Do have a little more faith in the people around you!</li>
  <li>Aurelia: The men look up to you greatly, even more so than our enemies would fear you.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: That is a good thing!</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Let them fight with you, not behind you!</li>
  <li>Ultor: …</li>
  <li>Ultor: Indeed, I made sure that my men become the best in Athensphere. The mightiest legion in this land!</li>
  <li>Ultor: I would only dishonor them, if I do not believe in their strength.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Thank you, my lady. I will not forget what you have said.</li>
  <li>Ultor: But now, I must go. I have a bad feeling about what is to come.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Lord Zedus will need me.</li>
  <li>Ultor: My men have secured this area, you’ll be safe here.</li>
  <li>Ultor: There are a great many wounded here who will need your attention, my lady.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Yes. My blessings to you, General.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Oh… one last thing.</li>
  <li>Aurelia: Watch your back, Ultor. This battle has only just begun…</li>
  <li>Ultor: …</li>
  <li>Ultor: I will, my lady.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Centurion! Come with me. It is likely that I will need your assistance soon.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Zedus: That battle wasn’t even much of a warm up.</li>
  <li>Zedus: There aren’t that many of those mechanical beasts in the area as well.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Will Ultor not spare me a bit of the action?</li>
  <li>Zedus: No, that is not how a leader should think.</li>
  <li>Zedus: To have been graced with subordinates are who are competent, how could I have asked for more?</li>
  <li>Zedus: Well, this is it. Gazia should be at the top of the mountains, past the Forum.</li>
  <li>Zedus: I hope he is alright…</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Ultor: Hmm, there is hardly anyone around here…</li>
  <li>Ultor: GAZIA!! WHERE ARE YOU???</li>
  <li>Zedus: Ultor! You really could shout our enemies to death with that voice of yours.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Was that how you defeated them all so quickly?</li>
  <li>Zedus: There was hardly any of them left behind… must you take all the fun away from me?</li>
  <li>Ultor: As you have commanded, my lord. I have drawn the enemy forces away from the Forum and eliminated them.</li>
  <li>Ultor: It seems to me that my men and I were not thorough enough if a few of those vermin slipped past us…</li>
  <li>Ultor: I will see to it that you’ll have nothing left to clean up after us  the next time, my lord!</li>
  <li>Zedus: Bah! That insolence of yours is getting on my nerves.</li>
  <li>Zedus: If you would just…</li>
  <li>Zedus: CRASH!!!</li>
  <li>???: Hmm… I should’ve thought so.</li>
  <li>???: Trying to catch the both of you off guard would be impossible.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Hah! Not fast enough you…</li>
  <li>Ultor: Draegar? What do you think you’re doing?</li>
  <li>Ultor: Speak! You’d better have a good reason for this…</li>
  <li>Zedus: Attacking your lord and master from behind?</li>
  <li>Zedus: And trying to take on both of us at the same time?</li>
  <li>Zedus: You must be incredibly brave… or foolish.</li>
  <li>Draegar: HAHAHA! I have only one master, and I serve no other but him alone!</li>
  <li>Draegar: I wonder… could I defeat both the almighty Zedus and Ultor with my new power?</li>
  <li>Draegar: This would be the perfect opportunity to put it to the test!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Get behind me, my lord!</li>
  <li>Ultor: This mad man is intent on attacking us!</li>
  <li>Zedus: Who do you think I am, Ultor?</li>
  <li>Zedus: I lead the people of Athensphere! My place is always to be in the front of everyone.</li>
  <li>Zedus: I want him alive, Ultor. Gazia might already have been taken by him… and that master of his.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Then by your will, it shall be done!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Ultor: Hah… HAHAHA!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Draegar! You’re a powerful opponent indeed… but not strong enough!</li>
  <li>Ultor: What can you do all alone by yourself?</li>
  <li>Draegar: Aargh!!!</li>
  <li>Draegar: <em>Huff</em>… <em>puff</em>…</li>
  <li>Draegar: It seems that I have underestimated you both…</li>
  <li>Ultor: Speak, Draegar! Tell us what you know.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Then perhaps I will let you die with some dignity!</li>
  <li>Zedus: You cannot defeat us Dreagar.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Who is behind the attack? Where is Gazia?</li>
  <li>Draegar: Questions, questions, questions… You fools will never understand.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Draegar… You served as Gazia’s most trusted assistant.</li>
  <li>Zedus: You have both immensely contributed to the growth and progress of Athensphere.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Why are you doing this to your own people?</li>
  <li>Draegar: …</li>
  <li>Draegar: None of you fully realize the true potential we possess. We are meant for greater things.</li>
  <li>Draegar: We could be so much more… even greater than the Gods who made us!</li>
  <li>Draegar: Enough… I am fully aware that I am still no match against all of you combine.</li>
  <li>Draegar: If it is answers you seek, head to the Pantheon.</li>
  <li>Draegar: Perhaps he may be able to enlighten you where I have failed…</li>
  <li>Zedus: It seems like our greatest fear has come to pass…</li>
  <li>Zedus: Come, Ultor. Let us meet this old friend of ours.</li>
  <li>Ultor: At once, my lord.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Let us hear what he has to say for himself.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>???: So… Not even Draegar was able to stop you both.</li>
  <li>???: Well, that is to be expected.</li>
  <li>???: I have been waiting for you, Lord Zedus.</li>
  <li>???: It looks like you’ve brought Ultor along as well.</li>
  <li>Zedus: … Gazia…</li>
  <li>Gazia: Lost for words? How very unlike you, Lord Zedus.</li>
  <li>Gazia: Don’t you have something you’d like  to say?</li>
  <li>Ultor: That is enough Gazia!</li>
  <li>Ultor: You have commited the heinous act of treason against the state!</li>
  <li>Ultor: There is nowhere else to run to! Surrender yourself now and we might show you some mercy!</li>
  <li>Zedus: At ease, Ultor.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Gazia, it pains me to lose someone of your caliber.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Look at our city! Look at what you have contributed to our civilization!</li>
  <li>Zedus: Power reactors that power entire cities, advanced medical equipment and facilities, long distance  teleportation gates…</li>
  <li>Zedus: Your accomplishments alone would take a regular man centuries to achieve!</li>
  <li>Zedus: What is is that you seek, Gazia?</li>
  <li>Gazia: What is it like, being the ruler of an entire civilization?</li>
  <li>Gazia: You are a good leader, Zedus. You have always put the well-bring of Athensphere before everything else.</li>
  <li>Gazia: Incorruptible and iron-willed, you are the quintessential example of a perfect leader.</li>
  <li>Gazia: Lord Zedus, do you desire nothing more?</li>
  <li>Gazia: Have you ever wondered… what if…</li>
  <li>Gazia: What if you could become a God instead?</li>
  <li>Zedus: !!! A God you say!?</li>
  <li>Zedus: Have you lost your mind Gazia?</li>
  <li>Zedus: What foul spirit have you been possessed by?</li>
  <li>Ultor: We are wasting our breath on him, my lord!</li>
  <li>Ultor: This traitor is beyond salvation!</li>
  <li>Gazia: My accomplishments thus far are but stepping stones for a far greater purpose!</li>
  <li>Gazia: Far greater than anyone of you could possibly comprehend.</li>
  <li>Gazia: Look at what I’ve given you… You have all taken my gift to you for granted.</li>
  <li>Gazia: The people of Athensphere are growing lazy and complacent</li>
  <li>Gazia: There is no such thing as a pinnacle…</li>
  <li>Gazia: Evolution is limitless!</li>
  <li>Gazia: We are still imperfect. A far cry  from the Gods who made us.</li>
  <li>Gazia: I aspire to become far greater than any of the Gods!</li>
  <li>Gazia: I would create life!  A species of people that would be superior to us in every way!</li>
  <li>Gazia: I would create new civilizations! One more powerful than the other!</li>
  <li>Gazia: There is so much I would do…</li>
  <li>Gazia: but unlike the Gods, we are not eternal.</li>
  <li>Gazia: The first step would be to eliminate the weaknesses of the mortal body,</li>
  <li>Gazia: and creating one that would withstand the ravages of time!</li>
  <li>Gazia: What you have witnessed today is just a small taste of something greater to come…</li>
  <li>Gazia: Through the destruction of Athensphere do we earn our salvation!</li>
  <li>Gazia: And when the deed is done, I will have surpassed my old self!</li>
  <li>Zedus: It is a sad day indeed… the greatest mind of Athensphere has fallen to madness.</li>
  <li>Zedus: I cannot allow a heretic like you live!</li>
  <li>Zedus: SHRIEK!!!</li>
  <li>Ultor: What the…!!!</li>
  <li>Ultor: What in the world is that?</li>
  <li>Zedus: Another enemy!? Get ready Ultor.</li>
  <li>Zedus: This one looks different from the rest we have faced thus far…</li>
  <li>Gazia: MWAHAHAHA! Struggle with all your might!</li>
  <li>Gazia: The time for change is now. The cogs of wa have started to turn!</li>
  <li>Gazia: Are you ready for what is about to come? Well, I think not!</li>
  <li>Gazia: There are matters of great import I must attend to.</li>
  <li>Gazia: My new pet here shall keep you… entertained.</li>
  <li>Gazia: I do hope that we will meet again.</li>
  <li>Zedus: GAZIA!!!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Eyes on the enemy ahead my lord!</li>
  <li>Ultor: Here it comes!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Zedus: How many of these monstrosities have Gazia made?</li>
  <li>Zedus: It took us considerable effort to take it down. Our regular troops will not stand a chance…</li>
  <li>Ultor: They will learn to crush it or die trying, my lord.</li>
  <li>Zedus: … Have I made a mistake somewhere?</li>
  <li>Zedus: I should have seen the corruption eating away at Gazia.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Now Athensphere must pay for my lack of foresight.</li>
  <li>Ultor: You have not done anything wrong, my lord.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Everything you’ve done was in the interest of Athensphere.</li>
  <li>Ultor: What has happened cannot be undone. Let us turn our attention towards the problem at hand.</li>
  <li>Ultor: Now, we are at war.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Thank you, Ultor. You speak true.</li>
  <li>Zedus: Let us return back to the palace.</li>
  <li>Zedus: We must begin preparations for the battles ahead of us.</li>
  <li>Noel: Oh,! You’re awake, excellent!</li>
  <li>Noel: Here, let me get the “Memory Gear” off you…</li>
  <li>Noel: There you go. Good thing the crystal  didn’t blow up like the last o…</li>
  <li>Noel: <em>BANG!!!</em></li>
  <li>Noel: …</li>
  <li>Noel: Aha… hahaha…</li>
  <li>Noel: Well, that was awkward. But hey! You’re still in one piece!</li>
  <li>Noel: That’s all that matters, right?</li>
  <li>Noel: Anyway, tell me everything you have seen! Right from the beginning!</li>
  <li>Noel: …</li>
  <li>Noel: That’s it? Nothing more?</li>
  <li>Noel: Tsk… I was hoping that crystal contained more information relevant to Gazia’s research.</li>
  <li>Noel: More importantly, information about his current self.</li>
  <li>Noel: The demigods may be trapped within the Void, but that doesn’t mean they are not a threat to us.</li>
  <li>Noel: Still, any information regarding Gazia would be good.</li>
  <li>Noel: Should the worst, happen, we’ll be ready to fight back.</li>
  <li>Noel: It’ll take my some time to improve and fix the “Memory Gear”</li>
  <li>Noel: In any case, I look forward to working with you again.</li>
  <li>Noel: Don’t you worry! I’ll get it right the next time, I promise!</li>
