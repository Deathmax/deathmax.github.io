Barienna is able to create a magical barrier that blocks most forms of damage. Not only is she adept at using magic, she is also a highly talented swordswoman, capable of standing her own ground when faced with a powerful opponent. Behind the harsh exterior Barienna displays, she is pure of heart and would give her life to protect the lives of those she loves.</li>

  <li><strong>Evo Mat</strong>: Light Mecha God, Miracle Totem, 2x Light Totem, Legend Stone</li>
  <li><strong>Lore</strong>: A mock unit modeled after Gazia, the traitorous demi-god who brought about the destruction of an entire civilization. Evidence pointing to Gazia’s dark fascinations on evolution and his undying thirst for knowledge could be said to have led to his eventual descent into madness. Utilizing centuries worth of knowledge he had accumulated from his research, his heavily augmented body would have been the ultimate synergy of science and magic, a walking weapon of mass destruction. When asked about validity of the Unit’s accuracy compared to original Gazia, all Noel mentioned was “it takes a genius to understand another genius.”</li>
  <li><strong>Dialogue</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evo</strong>: HAHAHA! And to think they call me mad! Are you certain that helping me, your enemy, is the wisest course of action?</li>
      <li><strong>Fusion 6*</strong>: This is your so called “Fusion?” Primitive! Nevertheless… effective. Ever wonder what truly happens during the process?</li>
      <li><strong>Fusion 7*</strong>: Are you certain you are not in need of “Fusion” yourself? Do you not see that it could far more efficient than what it currently is?</li>
      <li><strong>Get 6*</strong>: Well, well… what do we have here? Another “Child of the Prophecy”? This should be highly entertaining!</li>
      <li><strong>Get 7*</strong>: Pinnacle? Limits? Such are the concepts that I simply cannot fathom! I am of unlimited potential!</li>

  <li>There is no power in flesh. Only weakness.</li>

  <li>Feast your eyes on absolute divinity!</li>
  <li>With my mind and will as testament. I will not be shaken.</li>
  <li>The only certainty of flesh is death!!</li>
  <li>Fascinating! His prowness in battle is greatly augmented by his brilliant mind. I’ve gleaned much just from your fight alone. You may leave now!</li>

<h2 id="leagues">Leagues</h2>

<p>The Challenge Arena is divided into 3 Leagues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rookie League</li>
  <li>Summoner League</li>
  <li>Legendary League</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="battles">Battles</h2>

<p>You will face a series of progressively stronger opponents. Defeat them to gain ranking points and drops!</p>

<p>Battles will be auto-battle style similar to the Arena. The team who defeated all opponent’s Units will be the winner. You will not be able to progress to the next opponent until the current opponent has been defeated.</p>

<p>If the timer runs out before any squad has been defeated, the following conditions will determine the winner, in order of priority :</p>

<ol>

      <li>Unit must be at the rarity and level equal to or higher than the League’s requirement</li>
      <li>If similar units of equal strength exists, one of them will be chosen at random.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>League Unit Requirements
    <ul>
      <li>You can check the League Requirements at the notice board before you enter the Challenge Arena.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>SQUAD SETUP TIP</p>

<p>Summon more Units if you need, and they will be automatically included in your arena reserve (As long as they meet the qualifying requirements for your League!)</p>

<p>BATTLE TIP</p>

<p>Remember to bring your Healers along to heal your Units!</p>

<p>BATTLE TIP</p>

<p>Store your BB gauge charged for tough opponents!</p>

<p><del>Mats are obtained from clearing X4.</del></p>

<h2 id="bow-of-andaria">Bow of Andaria</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Status Boost</li>
  <li>+30% HP/ATK, +150% BB Modifier</li>
  <li>Materials: Euryalis’ Grace, Void Chunk</li>
  <li>Lore: The bow once used by the gifted Andaria was a difficult and heavy weapon to use. Without a proper bowstring attached to it, the bow instead draws power from its bearer and turns it into a lethal projectile of pure energy. Masters of the weapon like Andaria could fire a variety of projectiles types, from a barrage of bolts to a high-powered shot. Reforged by a mysterious smith, this replica is still a lethal weapon that could effectively convert one’s own spritual energy into devastating bolt of energy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spear-of-zedus">Spear of Zedus</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Status Boost</li>
  <li>+20% All Stats, +4-6 BC on Crit</li>
  <li>Materials: Grievesnare’s Will, Void Chunk</li>
  <li>Lore: Weapon of the Lord of Athensphere, this legendary spear could be wielded by no one but Zedus himself. The spear itself is believed to contain an immense amount of power, capable of powering a city a hundered times the size of the Imperial Capital Randall on its own. Using the lost records recovered from the lost civilization, this replica was forged by a mysterious stranger. From one end to another, the entire spear is a weapon itself. Attempting to hold it with your bare hands would be akin to holding on to a live lightning bolt.</li>
