On the battlefield, Aludra is a fearsome sight to behold. Casting one spell after another in rapid succession, one would think that Aludra could cast multiple spells simultaneously with barely any incantation required. In fact, she is able to cast spells so rapidly that unlike other mages, she can effectively fight in close quarters combat using her magic, as well as her swordsmanship. It is said that after failing to save the life of her friend after a freak magical experiment, Aludra finally found her true conviction. She pledged to use her powers to help the weak who are unable to fend for themselves. And the only way for her to achieve her mission is to further develop the art of magic through its practical applications.</li>

Behind the harsh exterior Barienna displays, she is pure of heart and would give her life to protect the lives of those she loves.</li>

  <li><strong>Evo Mat</strong>: Light Mecha God, Miracle Totem, 2x Light Totem, Legend Stone</li>
  <li><strong>Lore</strong>: A mock unit modeled after Gazia, the traitorous demi-god who brought about the destruction of an entire civilization. Evidence pointing to Gazia’s dark fascinations on evolution and his undying thirst for knowledge could be said to have led to his eventual descent into madness. Utilizing centuries worth of knowledge he had accumulated from his research, his heavily augmented body would have been the ultimate synergy of science and magic, a walking weapon of mass destruction. When asked about validity of the Unit’s accuracy compared to original Gazia, all Noel mentioned was “it takes a genius to understand another genius.”</li>
  <li><strong>Dialogue</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evo</strong>: HAHAHA! And to think they call me mad! Are you certain that helping me, your enemy, is the wisest course of action?</li>
      <li><strong>Fusion 6*</strong>: This is your so called “Fusion?” Primitive! Nevertheless… effective. Ever wonder what truly happens during the process?</li>
      <li><strong>Fusion 7*</strong>: Are you certain you are not in need of “Fusion” yourself? Do you not see that it could far more efficient than what it currently is?</li>
      <li><strong>Get 6*</strong>: Well, well… what do we have here? Another “Child of the Prophecy”? This should be highly entertaining!</li>
      <li><strong>Get 7*</strong>: Pinnacle? Limits? Such are the concepts that I simply cannot fathom! I am of unlimited potential!</li>

<h2 id="leagues">Leagues</h2>

<p>The Challenge Arena is divided into 3 Leagues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rookie League</li>
  <li>Summoner League</li>
  <li>Legendary League</li>
</ol>

<p>[Ranking Points &amp; Rewards]</p>

<h2 id="battles">Battles</h2>

<p>You will face a series of progressively stronger opponents. Defeat them to gain ranking points and drops!</p>

<p>Battles will be auto-battle style similar to the Arena. The team who defeated all opponent’s Units will be the winner. You will not be able to progress to the next opponent until the current opponent has been defeated.</p>

<p>If the timer runs out before any squad has been defeated, the following conditions will determine the winner, in order of priority :</p>

<ol>

      <li>Unit must be at the rarity and level equal to or higher than the League’s requirement</li>
      <li>If similar units of equal strength exists, one of them will be chosen at random.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>League Unit Requirements
    <ul>
      <li>You can check the League Requirements at the notice board before you enter the Challenge Arena.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<h2 id="bow-of-andaria">Bow of Andaria</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Status Boost</li>
  <li>+30% HP/ATK, +150% BB Modifier</li>
  <li>Materials: Euryalis’ Grace, Void Chunk</li>
  <li>Lore: The bow once used by the gifted Andaria was a difficult and heavy weapon to use. Without a proper bowstring attached to it, the bow instead draws power from its bearer and turns it into a lethal projectile of pure energy. Masters of the weapon like Andaria could fire a variety of projectiles types, from a barrage of bolts to a high-powered shot. Reforged by a mysterious smith, this replica is still a lethal weapon that could effectively convert one’s own spritual energy into devastating bolt of energy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spear-of-zedus">Spear of Zedus</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Status Boost</li>
  <li>+20% All Stats, +4-6 BC on Crit</li>
  <li>Materials: Grievesnare’s Will, Void Chunk</li>
  <li>Lore: Weapon of the Lord of Athensphere, this legendary spear could be wielded by no one but Zedus himself. The spear itself is believed to contain an immense amount of power, capable of powering a city a hundered times the size of the Imperial Capital Randall on its own. Using the lost records recovered from the lost civilization, this replica was forged by a mysterious stranger. From one end to another, the entire spear is a weapon itself. Attempting to hold it with your bare hands would be akin to holding on to a live lightning bolt.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Lore</strong>: Somewhere deep within a forest not too far from the old capital of Athensphere, rumors of a large resistance force fighting Gazia’s machines in the region spread. Countless mechs riddled with holes were lay strewn across the forest ground. However, the rumors were part of a reckless but desperate plan hatched by Andaria to draw the attention of her allies. Harnessing the power granted by the Euryalis, Andria was able to sense her enemies even before seeing them. She could feel their every movement from miles away, then attack from incredible distances by rainning down missiles upon them with deadly accuracy. Depsite her dire situation, she was thankful that Ultor had assigned her to defend a different location of the city. Deep beneath the ruined city of Athensphere unbeknowst to all except for a select few historians of Athensphere was a massive library housing centuries worth of information and knowledge. There, sealed within an emergency life support system slept the lord of Athensphere. With neither the means nor resources to revive him, Andaria countinued hunting, hoping that her efforts would draw the attention of her allies.</li>

  <li><strong>Lore</strong>: During the second invasion upon Athensphere, Gazia unleashed another horde of mechanical beasts that dwarfed the first. Zedus knew that the city was lost and that his people did not stand a chance against Gazia and his mechanical army. But Zedus had not given up. He ordered the City of Athensphere to be abandoned and it’s people evacuated. Tridon was to carry the citzens to safety aboard his ships. Ultor, Hadaron and Aurelia remained behind to hold off Gazia’s horde while the people fled. Zedus knew that he didn’t have enough time to evacuate an entire city. He had to buy them more no matter the cost. Climbing to the highest point of the imperial palace, Zedus poured his life force into one final attack, summoning a lightning storm that engulfed the entire city. Lightning bolts fell relentlessly upon Athesphere, each taking the form of a raging Thunder beast that hunted it’s enemy with terrifying speed. When the storm subsided, the only sounds to be heard came from the distant habour packed with frightened people desperate to flee the city. With a final breathe, Zedus bade his people one last farewell. Little did he know of a far greater disaster that was about to befall Athensphere.</li>
