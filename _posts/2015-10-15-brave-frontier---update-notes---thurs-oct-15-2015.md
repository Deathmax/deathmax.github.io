* **Lore**: A mage from another world guided by the Chain Chronicle. Acknowledged to have mastered all forms of magic, she is a master mage of the highest renown. On the battlefield, Aludra is a fearsome sight to behold. Casting one spell after another in rapid succession, one would think that Aludra could cast multiple spells simultaneously with barely any incantation required. In fact, she is able to cast spells so rapidly that unlike other mages, she can effectively fight in close quarters combat using her magic, as well as her swordsmanship. It is said that after failing to save the life of her friend after a freak magical experiment, Aludra finally found her true conviction. She pledged to use her powers to help the weak who are unable to fend for themselves. And the only way for her to achieve her mission is to further develop the art of magic through its practical applications.
