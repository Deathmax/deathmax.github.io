* LS: Negates all status ailments, 20% boost to max Def and Rec for all Units & boost to HC and BC drop rate (20%)

* *Aurelia of the Light, as some called her. A demi-god born on the first light of the first day. Aurelia encompassed the kindness and humanity that Athensphere so sorely needed. There were those who wielded power, might, and intellect for the sake of the lands, but she held a gentleness that charmed every warrior's soul, bringing them in touch with their own humanity. She was the 'mother' that all young-demi-gods went to in times of need for comfort and advice. Seeing no end to the incoming hoards of the Iron Army, Aurelia bound the wings of a Stormwing to herself in desperation. With her newfound power and the gift of flight, she was able to traverse long distances rapidly. Her tireless devotion saved the lives of many during the war. It is said that Aurelia was held in such high regard by the demi-gods, that they looked upon her as their savior and second leader in command.*

She was the 'mother' that all young-demi-gods went to in times of need for comfort and advice. When the Augmentation Wars broke out, Aurelia was appointed Grand Healer by Zedus. Together with a pair of twinborn cupids who were in her service, they attended to the casualties of the war. But as the war raged on, Aurelia was forced to fight the enemies who started breaching the region.*

Their sharp claws and mechanical bodies allow these highly intelligent souls to take more damage and punishment than their original bodies. They can reach hazardous areas or pursue enemies at unmatched speeds, making them a highly lethal opponent on the battlefield. Created to self-preserve and evolve, Stormwings salvage the battlefields for parts to upgrade themselves in order to improve their abilities and power.*
