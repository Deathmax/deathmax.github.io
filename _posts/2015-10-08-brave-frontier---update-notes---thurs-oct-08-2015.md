* **Lore**: A forest sprite from another world guided by the Chain Chronicle. As the avatar of the Silver Wolf, Barienna possesses far more power than the average forest sprite. Pure of heart and devoted towards the people of Sea Breeze, she chooses to use her powers to defend her people from the evil-doers that seek to harm them. Barienna is able to create a magical barrier that blocks most forms of damage. Not only is she adept at using magic, she is also a highly talented swordswoman, capable of standing her own ground when faced with a powerful opponent. Behind the harsh exterior Barienna displays, she is pure of heart and would give her life to protect the lives of those she loves.

* **Lore**: A mock unit modeled after Gazia, the traitorous demi-god who brought about the destruction of an entire civilization. Evidence pointing to Gazia’s dark fascinations on evolution and his undying thirst for knowledge could be said to have led to his eventual descent into madness. Utilizing centuries worth of knowledge he had accumulated from his research, his heavily augmented body would have been the ultimate synergy of science and magic, a walking weapon of mass destruction. When asked about validity of the Unit’s accuracy compared to original Gazia, all Noel mentioned was "it takes a genius to understand another genius."
* **Evo Dialogue**: HAHAHA! And to think they call me mad! Are you certain that helping me, your enemy, is the wisest course of action?

##Trial Dialogue

* So this is the technology of the future. How primitive...
* There is no power in flesh. Only weakness.
* This meatbag is surprisingly efficient. Perhaps augmentation would improve your visuals.
* Feast your eyes on absolute divinity!
* With my mind and will as testament. I will not be shaken.
* The only certainty of flesh is death!!
* Fascinating! His prowness in battle is greatly augmented by his brilliant mind. I’ve gleaned much just from your fight alone. You may leave now!

#Zedus/Andaria ES Spheres

Mats are obtained from clearing X4.

##Bow of Andaria

* Lore: The bow once used by the gifted Andaria was a difficult and heavy weapon to use. Without a proper bowstring attached to it, the bow instead draws power from its bearer and turns it into a lethal projectile of pure energy. Masters of the weapon like Andaria could fire a variety of projectiles types, from a barrage of bolts to a high-powered shot. Reforged by a mysterious smith, this replica is still a lethal weapon that could effectively convert one’s own spritual energy into devastating bolt of energy.

##Spear of Zedus

* Lore: Weapon of the Lord of Athensphere, this legendary spear could be wielded by no one but Zedus himself. The spear itself is believed to contain an immense amount of power, capable of powering a city a hundered times the size of the Imperial Capital Randall on its own. Using the lost records recovered from the lost civilization, this replica was forged by a mysterious stranger. From one end to another, the entire spear is a weapon itself. Attempting to hold it with your bare hands would be akin to holding on to a live lightning bolt.
