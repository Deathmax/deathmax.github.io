## Dialogue

* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvIntro0010Teshin": "The Lotus seduced the Tenno. Lead them on a complacent path like Oxen. I failed the Orokin but I will preserve what remains. The Tenno. Cast off your harness and become a pupil of the Conclave. Through trial combat, I will prepare you for the evils beyond the Outer Terminus. A warrior only grows if they face the ultimate enemy. Themselves."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvIntro0020Teshin": "While you slept, I wandered the long path. I searched for a true balance, a challenge to meet my own. Now, through the beacon of the relays I have returned, only to find my fellow warriors herded like sheep. I too was like you, lost and confused. I had forgotten The Conclave and when the darkness came I was not prepared. Once more the darkness comes, will you be ready? Accept its teachings and the Conclave will be your teacher. I am merely its humble guide. Through its crucible you may forge true strength. By walking it's path you may gain true balance."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvWelcome0010Teshin": "Welcome pupil. You are a sapling, growing under moonshade. The battlefield your garden. Tenno blood, your water. Now you must grow."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvNewRnkAvbl0010Teshin": "My pupil, the next summit awaits. Are ready to make the climb?"
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvNewRnkAchd0010Teshin": "Your growth honors the Conclave. But be warned, pupil. The highest leaves attract the tallest predators."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvLvd0010Teshin": "Well met, Master. You bring honorâ€¦ and fear, to the Conclave."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvOpnRepStr0010Teshin": "Those who brave the thorn may eat the rare fruit."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvOpnRepStr0020Teshin": "These offerings honor your suffering and practice."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvOpnRepStr0030Teshin": "You seek power, you pay in blood."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvPchsRepStr0010Teshin": "May it bring you honor, pupil."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DCnclvPchsRepStr0020Teshin": "Use it well, as you walk the harder path."

* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DMsnThree0100Lotus": "Nothing can replace the relays we lost, but you have made a statement to the system. Tenno avenge their dead."
* "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/DMsnThree0110VayHek": "You have restored balance to the system - the actions of Vay Hek against the Tenno have been reconciled thanks to your skill and dedication, Tenno."
