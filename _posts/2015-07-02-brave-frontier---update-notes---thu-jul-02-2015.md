#Flora Aegis Edea

*One of the four legendary warriors who fought to save the Kingdom of Palmyna. Managing to seal Cardes in the underworld, Edea fell into a deep slumber while still clad in her sparkling armor, Lafdranya. However, after hearing her comrades call her name, Edea woke once again, weakening the seal on Cardes in the process. Having decided anew to defeat the Fallen God alongside her dear friends, Edea's Lafdranya transformed itself into a great sword in order to help its owner's will become a reality.*

#Inferno Princess Alice

*Having lost her life in battle, Alice continued to dye her sickle with the blood of her enemies while unconscious. This was due to the fact that she had collected a countless amount of souls while cursing the world during her lifetime. However, Alice suddenly recovered her consciousness when amongst the numerous souls in her body, a light spoke softly to her. She had no recollection of what the light was, but she got a familiar feeling from it nevertheless. As tears streamed down her face, she muttered the word "sister" to herself, and began to fight for her survival with both darkness and light within her.*

#Celestial Archer Loch

*One of the four legendary warriors who fought to save the Kingdom of Palmyna. After Edea sacrificed herself in order to save her friends, Loch refused to believe she was dead, striving instead to locate the rest of his comrades who had been scattered during the fight against Cardes. After finding Edea in the underworld, he began to give a eulogy in her honor when Cardes suddenly attacked. It was during this fight that Loch realized his bow had become stronger every time the bonds of friendship he shared with his comrades deepened. And once the person he loved most of all opened her eyes again, the force of his arrows is said to have surpassed that of the gods.*
