#Temptress Xie'Jing (6*)

![Illustration](//i.imgur.com/HByzblL.png){: .img-responsive}

*My, my… what do we have here? What a charming face you have. Come here, darling… I promise, I don’t bite…*

* **Lore**: *Mock Unit of the witch Xie’ Jing. Xie’ Jing was a witch that bears great resemblance to that of a beautiful woman. She was known as a bringer of plague and pestilence, bearing a deep hatred of humans. However, she was better remembered as a vile temptress who seduced handsome young men and manipulated them to do her bidding. When she tire of them, she drained their life force to maintain her youth and beauty. With the aid of a mysterious Summoner, Xie’Jing was finally defeated by a feisty young lady by the name of Fang. The Summoner was able to provide Noel with valuable information regarding the fallen witch, thus the development of the mock unit Xie’ Jing. While not quite as formidable as the original witch, the unit Temptress Xie’ Jing is more than just a pretty face. Her mastery over the elements and her reputation as a plague bringer will introduce unsuspecting foes a whole new world of pain.*

Her small stature belies her tyrannical personality, a reuslt of centuries of being alone with nobody but her most loyal servants.

Her conquest went on swiftly as nobody took her seriously, but she was eventually defeated when she took on the more powerful gods. Sacrificing a part of her powers and adamantly refusing defeat, she is now doing everything she can to regain her lost glory.*
