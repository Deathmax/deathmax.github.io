* 7\* Lore: *Like the leader of the demigod Zedus, Deimos was had a strong affinity to the element of Thunder. Deimos's massive figure towered over the battlefield; his very presence alone bolstered the morale of Zedus's men. He also favoured fighting deep within enemy ranks alone, where he could unleash his full strength with minimal collateral damage. Every blow from Forgebreaker onto the ground sounded like the clap of thunder, shattering the earth beneath his feet. In time, Deimos's legendary feats on the battlefield made him a high priority target. His very presence alone was a big enough threat that drew the attention of enemy forces away from his allies and onto him. When word of Gazia's attemp to create a gate to escape the void reached his ears, he lead a small strike team toward the site. What became of him thereafter remains unknown.*

* 7\* Lore: *A cuborg designed for assassination, created by the mad demigod Gazia. After untold centuries of research and modifications, Gazia finally found a way to put Zenia under his control. He had a massive facility specially contructed to seal Zenia within. That was the facility's secondary purpose. It's main purpose was to serve as an energy conduit that could channel the energies of the void into Zenia, amplifying her powers exponentially. With the Conduit funneling immense amount of energy into her, Zenia tore open a rift in the Void. But in the process, the artificial intelligence system that overrides Zenia's control over her own body malfuntioned under the immense energy load. Zenia unleashed an attack so powerful that broke the land into several pieces before using the last of her strength to shift the Conduit out of the Void, beyond the reach of Gazia and his mechanical army.*
