* **Forgebreaker**: *Using techniques developed by the Master Smiths of Athensphere, an incredibly dense ore of unkown origins was forged into a massive warhammer. The process was said to have been so intense that the Scared Forge was left in a state beyond repair, thus its name Forgebreaker. Forgebreaker was gifted to Deimos by Zedus, inrecognition of his unrivalled strength and pledge of loyalty. Every blow from Forgehammer sounded like a massive clap of thunder, shattering the ground in its immediate vicinity. It is rumored that the ore was obtained from the Void itself and within it houses an unimmaginable amount of raw energy. The mysterious energy from the warhammer is believed to grant its bearer extraordinary stamina, allowing Deimos to fight for days on end.*

* 7\* Lore: *Like Zedus, the leader of the demigods, Deimos had a strong affinity to the element of Thunder. Deimos's massive figure towered over the battlefield, and his very presence alone bolstered the morale of Zedus's men. He also favored fighting deep within enemy ranks alone, where he could unleash his full strength with minimal collateral damage. Every blow from Forgebreaker onto the ground sounded like the clap of thunder, shattering the earth beneath his feet. In time, Deimos's legendary feats on the battlefield made him a high priority target. His very presence was a big enough threat that it drew the attention of enemy forces away from his allies and onto him. When word of Gazia's attempt to create a gate to escape the void reached his ears, he lead a small strike team toward the site. What became of him thereafter remains unknown.*

* **Obsidian Core Amplifier**: *A small jet black sphere no bigger than the fist of young child retrieved from the site of the void rift. The occasional flash of purple light from the sphere reveals a highly intricate network of lines carved underneath its smooth surface. Gazia created this power amplifier to boost Zenia's abilities exponentially. It was specifically designed to forcefully "awaken" Zenia's potential at manipulating the gates across worlds. With the power amplifier activated, it grants it's bearer unmatched physical capabilities, at the risk of damaging one's own body permernantly.*

* 7\* Lore: *A cyborg designed for assassination created by the mad demigod Gazia. After untold centuries of research and modifications, Gazia finally found a way to put Zenia under his control. He had a massive facility especially constructed to seal Zenia within, but that was only the facility's secondary purpose. It's main purpose was actually to serve as an energy conduit that could channel the energies of the void into Zenia, amplifying her powers exponentially. With the Conduit funneling an immense amount of energy into her, Zenia tore open a rift in the Void. But in the process, the artificial intelligence system that had overridden Zenia's control over her own body malfunctioned under the immense energy load. Zenia then unleashed an attack so powerful that it broke the land into several pieces before using the last of her strength to shift the Conduit out of the Void, and beyond the reach of Gazia and his mechanical army.*
