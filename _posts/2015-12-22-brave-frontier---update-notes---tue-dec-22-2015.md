* **5\* Lore**: In the snow-bound mountain region of the far North, there exists an impossibly lush and bountiful Vale. Legends tell that in ancient times, a gigantic floating tree drifted in the skies for a hundred years before disappearing. Frozen creeks transformed into flowing rivers, temperate vegetation sprang forth in a mystical miracle. The Vale became a bastion for various wildlife and a host of Fae spirits. The Fae were good-natured, innocent and made the woods ring with merriment everyday. However, a great danger loomed over them in the form of invading goblin hordes that were attracted by the food as well as magical energies of the Vale. The Fae were no match for the savagery of the goblins and were driven back. In their dark hour, they congregated at a massive tree that had sprouted at the center of the Vale and began chanting, thousands of voices soared in harmony. Their myriad of wills and desires for a savior and guardian culminated in a blinding pillar of turquoise light that sundered the clouds high above. The final manifestation of this bewitching event was a mythical deity brought to life. She was known as Zeruiah and all Fae unanimously bowed before her.
* **6\* Lore**: Zeruiah was one with the Vale. With the Fae rallied behind, the deity turned wildlife, plants and the very elements against the goblin invaders. Trees uprooted into towering treants that smashed the puny humanoids by the dozens. Stags and boars charged and impaled any greenskins that survived the onslaught of mighty Earth and Water elementals. In one fell swoop, the goblin swarm was defeated and routed out of the Vale. Drawing on her divine powers, Zeruiah erected wards and summoned raging blizzards that would keep out evil monsters. For countless millennia, the Vale flourished and expanded under the protection and rule of Zeruiah. The Fae channeled and constructed majestic Vaults in which they stored all sorts of treasures, tomes and artifacts collected or crafted over the ages. Knowledge of these Vaults gradually leaked to the world outside and many civilizations sought to gain entry into the Vale, fueled by greed and curiosity. From historical records, none made it in.
* **7\* Lore**: An Eternal Preserver of all the treasures and knowledge of the Vale in the far North, summoned at the behest of the Fae to rule over and protect the land. One day, Zeruiah discovered that a small girl had somehow gotten pass the wards and gained access to the Vale. After observing the girl for days, Zeruiah grew fascinated at how such a young human was able to command the snow and ice. The Fae and animals initially assisted the girl with sustenance at Zeruiah's command, but eventually she was brought into the heart of the Vale. Despite her mistrust of humans, Zeruiah grew to love the girl, training and watching her grow up. Through this encounter, Zeruiah saw that not all humans were evil, and began opening up the Vale to druid tribes and scholars sent by Human kingdoms once every year - marked by a Fae festival called Hanukkah.

##Frozen Fantasy

Long deemed unconquerable by mere mortals. The stone was lost to the deep wintertide. In one of the coldest winters known to date, it was discovered by a duo who came across it in a forgotten cave, as if being called out by it. Both were immediately ensnared by its power and a great battle for ownership ensued. In the morning, only one walked out of the cave. The direction taken, however, was not towards home but deeper into the wintertide.
