*I can't believe that I'm pairing up with lowly being like you! Just call me queen and we're even.*

* **Lore (4\*)**: *The pint-sized aquatic hybrid from beyond the abyss, overseer of the deepest depths beneath the ocean. Her small stature belies her tyrannical personality, a reuslt of centuries of being alone with nobody but her most loyal servants. Ages of being virtually unmatched in power in her realm spurred her to invade the surface world. Her conquest went on swiftly as nobody took her seriously, but she was eventually defeated when she took on the more powerful gods. Sacrificing a part of her powers and adamantly refusing defeat, she is now doing everything she can to regain her lost glory.*
