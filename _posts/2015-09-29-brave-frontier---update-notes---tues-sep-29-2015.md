I'm currently in the process of moving to the UK to start university, so I will not be around for maintanence to end (and therefore the info in this post may be incorrect) and for many days after that.

Official changelog can be found [here](http://news.gumi.sg/bravefrontier/news/files/html/2015-09/MaintenanceSept29_1443439248.html?os=0&friendId=).
