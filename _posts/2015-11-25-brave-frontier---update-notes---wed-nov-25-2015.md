* **Evo Mat**: (Miracle Totem, Fire Totem, 2x Dragon Mimic, Fire Bulb) -> (Fire Mecha God, 2x Miracle Totem, Metal Mimic, Fire Bulb)
* **Lore**: A notorious ravager from the world of Eneroth. Years of endless rampaging did not earn him any solace. Despite coming to be feared as one of Eneroth's mightiest warriors, Korzan's soul was left as empty as before. Determine to find a new purpose in life, he set off to seek a mysterious band of hunters rumored to consist of both Deva and Morokai. He was convinced that the person capable of uniting the people of two warring nations might be able to provide the answers he sought. Upon arriving at their camp, he discovered that their camp was attacked by a trio of Emperor Devil Scorpions, one of the deadliest beasts to roam the Baldemar Badlands. Following his battle instincts, Korzan jumped into the fray and quickly slayed one of the three scorpions. Ready to take on his next prey, he was stunned to find the other two scorpions defeated. Upon their carcass stood a warrior. On her head were the horns of the Morokai and on her back spanned the unmistakable wings of the Deva. One look into her eyes was enough for Korzan to understand the difference in power between them. He thought to himself that perhaps this person could be the one to help him find his destiny.
* **ES Sphere**: Vulcan Axe - Status Boost - +30% ATK/HP/Crit Chance, +50% ATK when BB Gauge Full
  * **Sphere Lore**: Korzan's treasured Vulcan Axe is a weapon like no other. Forged from orihalcum, the bone and crystallized heart of an Elder Magma Salamander, the Vulcan Axe was commissioned by Overlord Azurai to celebrate the birth of his son. The soul of the beast lived on within the weapon, but only a warrior worthy of its fiery might could call forth its true power. Although known for their extraordinary strength, the only known Morokai to have ever wielded the Vulcan Axe effectively were Overlord Azurai, and Korzan himself. In battle, the flames of the Salamander would engulf the weapon, making it capable of melting both metal and rock in a matter of seconds.

* **[Arena Type](https://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/340vh5/arena_ai_for_global_units_v2/)**: 2
* **Evo Mat**: (Miracle Totem, Water Totem, 2x Dragon Mimic, Water Bulb) -> (Water Mecha God, 2x Miracle Totem, Metal Mimic, Water Bulb)
* **Lore**: A renegade Deva battlemage from the world of Eneroth. After her defeat at the hands of the Destroyer, Haile was rescued by a band of Morokai hunters. She was surprised to discover that there were Deva living among them, and not as slaves, but as equals. Raised to fear the Morokai as the mortal enemies of the Deva, Haile was initially wary of those around her. However, the secluded lifestyle she had experienced behind the confines of the city walls made her encounter with the Morokai pique her curiosity. Choosing to seek a deeper understanding of the Morokai as she had once done to unravel the mysteries of magic, Haile came to embrace a different set of ideals and way of life. While her temperament remained unchanged, she now used her abilities to protect her new ideals and to save others from becoming mere casualties of war, regardless of their origins. Now known as the renegade "Ardent Ice Queen," Haile continued to disrupt the war efforts of both nations, hoping that her actions would help usher in a new era of peace.
* **ES Sphere**: Glacies Staff - Status Boost - +20% All Stats, 5-10% Reduced BB BC Use, +100% BB Mod
  * **Sphere Lore**: The Glacies Staff used by Haile has been heavily modified to suit her aggressive style of combat. The staff is forged entirely from mithril, an extremely durable but lightweight material found only within the mountain mines of Myrranthia. The crystal lacrima embedded into the staff is said to be the frozen tear of a legendary Ice Serpent, an incredibly rare resource that provides un-paralleled efficacy when channeling magic. In the hands of a novice the staff would rapidly deplete its bearer's mana, possibly killing them in the process. However, in the right hands it is capable of greatly reducing the casting time of spells while simultaneously magnifying its owner's powers.

##Missions

###RC3

* Of Wings and Horns
	* Mission orders from Tilith: Find a way home. It looks like you’ll be here for a while. I’ll look for a way to get you back home. Meanwhile you can make some friends! I saw a friendly looking man with pink hair just behind the forest, go say hello!
	* Target: Korzan
* Inner Daemons
	* Mission orders from Korzan: Find and retrieve the battlemage’s staff. I’ve been out longer than expected so I need to head back. Make sure everything is okay. I was out looking for my companion’s staff. She lost it while tracking a beast that has been causing a ruckus lately. Get it back for me and we’ll see about getting you home.
	* Target: Van Lucy and Van Nader
* Crowd Control
	* Mission orders from Korzan: Quell the restless Eidolons of the forest. Good work on finding the staff. I’ll get it back to the owner before she blows her top off on me again. Whatever’s been causing a stink has the whole forest riled up. Once peaceful eidolons are behaving oddly and even attacking people! I need you to go out there and paint the floor red!
	* Target: Laguna and others

###RC4

* White Rabbit
	* Mission orders from Korzan: Defeat Lesnik. The Lesnik is near. Every night we can hear its howls, driving the local eidolons into a frenzy. It’s angry and it doesn’t seem like it’s going away anytime soon. My scouts have discovered its location around the caves. They’ve got the entrances covered so now’s the time to get rid of it.
	* Target: Lesnik
* Hot and Hotter
	* Mission orders from Korzan: Find the battlemage and bring her back. That didn’t go as expected. This creature is clearly holding some kind of grudge against us. My companion, Haile, is going to the shrine to commune with the eidolons in an attempt to appease them. But I just received reports of Deva royal army troops in the area. She’s capable of taking care of herself but something doesn’t feel right. It’s probably nothing but go back her up, will ya?
	* Target: Balmedia and Haile
* Dazzle in the Dark
	* Mission orders from Concerned Mom: Search for my daughter! My daughter loves going into the forest to play with the eidolons. Even with the eidolons all worked up she still finds a way to slip out! Please find her for me! Who knows what she troubles she must be getting into!
	* Target: Nalda Delia and others

###RC5

* Queen for a Day
	* Mission orders from Haile: Defend the keep. That Deva squad that you routed is back, most likely still in pursuit of me. This time they sent eidolons of their own to do their dirty work. Take care of them before they reach the keep and harm more people.
	* Target: Grudkia and others
* The Coin Toss
	* Mission orders from Haile: Finish the Lesnik. The danged thing won’t let up! The keep’s walls won’t last long with the Lesnik constantly sending in attacks day and night. We have to send a surgical strike force to take it down before we lose it all. Korzan and I are busy directing the defence troops here and there’s no one left as capable except for you so you’re it. I’m taking a risk on you here. If you fail, our keep and everyone will be in peril.
	* Target: Jirayen and others
