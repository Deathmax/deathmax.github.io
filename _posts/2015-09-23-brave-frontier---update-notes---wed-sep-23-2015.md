* **Lore**: Somewhere deep within a forest not too far from the old capital of Athensphere, rumors of a large resistance force fighting Gazia's machines in the region spread. Countless mechs riddled with holes were lay strewn across the forest ground. However, the rumors were part of a reckless but desperate plan hatched by Andaria to draw the attention of her allies. Harnessing the power granted by the Euryalis, Andria was able to sense her enemies even before seeing them. She could feel their every movement from miles away, then attack from incredible distances by rainning down missiles upon them with deadly accuracy. Depsite her dire situation, she was thankful that Ultor had assigned her to defend a different location of the city. Deep beneath the ruined city of Athensphere unbeknowst to all except for a select few historians of Athensphere was a massive library housing centuries worth of information and knowledge. There, sealed within an emergency life support system slept the lord of Athensphere. With neither the means nor resources to revive him, Andaria countinued hunting, hoping that her efforts would draw the attention of her allies.

* **Lore**: During the second invasion upon Athensphere, Gazia unleashed another horde of mechanical beasts that dwarfed the first. Zedus knew that the city was lost and that his people did not stand a chance against Gazia and his mechanical army. But Zedus had not given up. He ordered the City of Athensphere to be abandoned and it's people evacuated. Tridon was to carry the citzens to safety aboard his ships. Ultor, Hadaron and Aurelia remained behind to hold off Gazia's horde while the people fled. Zedus knew that he didn't have enough time to evacuate an entire city. He had to buy them more no matter the cost. Climbing to the highest point of the imperial palace, Zedus poured his life force into one final attack, summoning a lightning storm that engulfed the entire city. Lightning bolts fell relentlessly upon Athesphere, each taking the form of a raging Thunder beast that hunted it's enemy with terrifying speed. When the storm subsided, the only sounds to be heard came from the distant habour packed with frightened people desperate to flee the city. With a final breathe, Zedus bade his people one last farewell. Little did he know of a far greater disaster that was about to befall Athensphere.
